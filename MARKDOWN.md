# Difference Between a Text File and a Markdown File

## Text File (.txt) vs Markdown File (.md)

- **Text File (.txt)**:
  - **File Extension:** `.txt`
  - Contains **plain text** with no formatting
  - Used for storing simple, unformatted content
  - Opened with any basic text editor
  - **Example:**
    ```
    This is a text file. No formatting.
    ```

- **Markdown File (.md)**:
  - **File Extension:** `.md`
  - Contains **formatted text** using markdown syntax (headings, bold, lists)
  - Can be rendered with formatting in compatible viewers (GitHub, etc.)
  - **Example:**
    ```markdown
    # Heading
    **Bold Text**
    - List item
    ```

## Key Difference:
- **Text files** store unformatted content, while **markdown files** support formatting with markdown syntax.
